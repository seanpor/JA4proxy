## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-03 — Security: Metrics Endpoint DoS & Startup Crash Remediation

### Added

- **Phase 71: Docker Isolation - Foundations & Registry (Proposed)** — Architecture for agent identity source of truth and automated environment generation.
- **Phase 72: Docker Isolation - Logical Network Zones (Proposed)** — Implementation of three-tier logical zones (DMZ, APP, ORIGIN) mirroring production security boundaries.
- **Phase 73: Docker Isolation - Host-Level Hardening (Proposed)** — Strict 'Two-Port Policy', loopback IP binding (127.0.0.x), and CPU partitioning on i9-9900K.
- **Phase 74: Docker Isolation - Shared Assets & Tooling (Proposed)** — Read-only GeoIP sharing across agent stacks and multi-agent support for admin scripts.
- **Phase 75: Docker Isolation - Security Audit & Validation (Proposed)** — Final Red Team validation and automated isolation verification scripts.

### Security

- **CVE-class: Metrics endpoint denial-of-service** — `src/security/health.py` and
  `src/analytics/main.py` both served `/metrics` via `web.Response(content_type=CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST)`.
  The prometheus-client `CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST` constant includes `charset=utf-8`, which aiohttp
  rejects at the Response constructor level with `ValueError: charset must not be in content_type
  argument`. Every scrape request to either metrics endpoint raised an unhandled exception, causing
  the handler to return HTTP 500 and preventing Prometheus from collecting telemetry. An attacker
  aware of this could use it to blind monitoring silently while conducting other activity.
  **Fix:** pass the Content-Type as a raw header (`headers={"Content-Type": CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST}`)
  in both locations. Confirmed no other `content_type=` usages in the codebase contain `charset`.

- **Startup crash (non-fatal log corruption)** — `proxy.py` emitted a structured JSON log line at
  startup using `%d` format for the initial dial value, which `DialManager.initialize()` returns as
  a string. Python's logging module suppresses the resulting `TypeError` with a `--- Logging error
  ---` banner rather than crashing the process, but the dial-initialized event was silently lost
  from the audit trail on every cold start.
  **Fix:** changed format specifier to `%s` with an explicit `int()` cast.

### Fixed

- HAProxy crash-loop on POC startup: three config errors introduced by Phase 43 blue/green changes
  (`accept-proxy` bare keyword, duplicate `frontend tls_in` block, missing errorfile) and backend
  servers referencing non-existent `proxy-worker-blue-*` containers. Rewritten for single-worker
  POC topology.
- `start-poc.sh` readiness checks used Docker Compose v1-style container names (`ja4proxy-redis`,
  `ja4proxy-backend`); Compose v2 appends `-1` suffix. Fixed to `ja4proxy-redis-1` /
  `ja4proxy-backend-1`.
- Analytics entrypoint used `nc` for Redis readiness check; `nc` is not installed in the analytics
  image, causing an infinite startup loop. Replaced with `python3 socket.connect_ex`.
