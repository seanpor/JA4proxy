JA4proxy POC Security Scan Summary
==================================
Scan Date: 2026-02-15
Environment: POC (Local Docker)

OVERALL STATUS
--------------
✅ POC: SAFE FOR LOCAL TESTING
🔴 Production: NOT READY (13 vulnerabilities)

VULNERABILITIES FOUND
---------------------
Critical (Production Impact):
1. 🔴 Hardcoded password "changeme" - FOUND
2. 🔴 Unpinned Docker images - FOUND
3. 🔴 Services exposed to 0.0.0.0 - FOUND
4. 🔴 No authentication on metrics - FOUND
5. 🔴 No TLS/SSL encryption - FOUND
6. 🔴 Missing security headers - FOUND

High Priority:
7. 🟡 Redis running as root - FOUND
8. 🟡 Container filesystem not read-only - FOUND
9. 🟡 No capability restrictions - FOUND
10. 🟡 Network not isolated - FOUND

Medium Priority:
11. 🟠 Verbose error messages - Minor
12. 🟠 Log directory permissions - Found
13. 🟠 Dependencies need CVE check - Needs verification

POC ASSESSMENT
--------------
Status: ✅ ACCEPTABLE FOR POC USE

Safe when:
✅ Running on localhost/isolated network
✅ Used by trusted users only
✅ Not exposed to internet
✅ Not processing production data
✅ Firewall configured (if shared network)

NOT safe for:
❌ Production workloads
❌ Public-facing deployments
❌ Real user data
❌ Compliance environments

PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
Status: 🔴 NOT READY WITHOUT FIXES

Must fix before production:
1. Strong passwords (32+ chars)
2. Enable TLS everywhere
3. Add authentication
4. Restrict to internal networks
5. Pin Docker images
6. Implement certificate validation
7. Run as non-root
8. Enable read-only filesystem
9. Drop capabilities
10. Network segmentation

Estimated timeline: 3-4 weeks
Estimated cost: $50k-75k

QUICK ACTIONS
-------------
For POC (optional improvements):
1. Set unique password via env var
2. Restrict ports to 127.0.0.1
3. Add firewall rules if needed

For Production:
1. Review ENTERPRISE_REVIEW.md
2. Follow security remediation roadmap
3. Conduct security audit
4. Perform penetration testing

See: ENTERPRISE_REVIEW.md (production roadmap)

The POC is READY FOR USE as a local testing environment.
It is NOT ready for production without significant security work.
